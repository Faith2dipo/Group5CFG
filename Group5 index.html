            One of the most exciting thing about coding is that it has no barriers. When creating your project, you don't need to think about physical restraints or limits. Once you learn to code, you have access to a powerful system for solving problems.

            I want to be a software developer because, designing computer programs lets me use my creative and problems-solving skills. The learning never stops too, there is always a new coding technique to learn that will help you solve even harder problems.
